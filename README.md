# Wine Whisperer

## About the App
Wine Whisperer helps you find the best value wines on restaurant wine lists. Simply take a photo of a restaurant wine list, and Wine Whisperer will analyze it to identify which wines offer the best value based on market prices.

## How It Works
1. **Scan a Wine List**: Use your phone camera to take a clear photo of any restaurant wine list
2. **Instant Analysis**: The app scans the list and compares the prices with market values
3. **Discover Value**: See which wines offer the best value on the list
4. **Share Findings**: Share your wine finds with friends and family
