## About the App
WineCheck helps you find the best value wines on restaurant wine lists. Simply take a photo of a restaurant wine list, and WineCheck will analyze it to identify which wines offer the best value based on market prices.

## How It Works

2. **Instant Analysis**: The app scans the list and compares the prices with market values
3. **Discover Value**: See which wines offer the best value on the list
4. **Share Findings**: Share your wine finds with friends and family
